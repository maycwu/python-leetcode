# Statement
# Given a string that may consist of opening and closing parentheses, your task is to check whether or not the string contains valid parenthesization.
#
# The conditions to validate are as follows:
#
# Every opening parenthesis should be closed by the same kind of parenthesis. Therefore, {)and [(]) strings are invalid.
#
# Every opening parenthesis must be closed in the correct order. Therefore, )( and ()(() are invalid.

# Example 1: (){[{()}]}
# Output: TRUE
